        <h4>An Enemy of the People Act 4</h4>
        <h4>Henrik Ibsen</h4>
        <p>1st Citizen (meeting another). Hello, Lamstad! You here too?<br>

            2nd Citizen. I go to every public meeting, I do.<br>
            
            3rd Citizen. Brought your whistle too, I expect!<br>
            
            2nd Citizen. I should think so. Haven't you?<br>
            
            3rd Citizen. Rather! And old Evensen said he was going to bring a
            cow-horn, he did.<br>
            
            2nd Citizen. Good old Evensen! (Laughter among the crowd.)<br>
            
            4th Citizen (coming up to them). I say, tell me what is going on here
            tonight?

        <p>It seems different; perhaps it's the night.</p>
        <h5>OLLIVANT</h5>
        <p>I guess it isn't up to its usual standard. Haven't seen your
            mother there so often this spring.</p>
        <h5>EMILY</h5>
        <p>[Quietly.]
        This dry spell is not good for flowers.</p>
