            <p class="speech_Citizen1">Hullo, Lamstad! You here too? </p>

            <h6 class="Citizen2">Citizen2.</h6> 
            <p class="speech_Citizen2">I go to every public meeting, I do.</p>
            
            <h6 class="Citizen1">Citizen1.</h6>
            <p class="speech_Citizen1">Brought your whistle too, I expect!</p>
            
            <h6 class="Citizen2">Citizen2.</h6> 
            <p class="speech_Citizen2">I should think so. Haven't you?</p>
            
            <h6 class="Citizen1">Citizen1.</h6>
            <p class="speech_Citizen1">Rather! And old Evensen said he was going to bring a
            cow-horn, he did.</p>
            
            <h6 class="Citizen2">Citizen2.</h6>
            <p class="speech_Citizen2">Good old Evensen!</p>
            <p class="direction">(Laughter among the crowd.)</p>

            <p class="speech_Citizen1">I say, tell me what is going on here
            tonight?</p>
            
            <h6 class="Citizen2">Citizen2.</h6>
            <p class="speech_Citizen2">Dr. Stockmann is going to deliver an address attacking the
            Mayor.</p>
            
            <h6 claa="Citizen1">Citizen1.</h6>
            <p class="speech_Citizen1">But the Mayor is his brother.</p>
            
            <h6 class="Citizen2">Citizen2.</h6>
            <p class="speech_Citizen2">That doesn't matter; Dr. Stockmann's not the chap to be
            afraid.</p>
            
            <h6 class="Citizen1">Citizen1.</h6>
            <p class="speech_Citizen1">But he is in the wrong; it said so in the “People's
            Messenger.”</p>
            
            <h6 class="Citizen2">Citizen2.</h6>
            <p class="speech_Citizen2">Yes, I expect he must be in the wrong this time, because neither
            the Householders' Association nor the Citizens' Club would lend him
            their hall for his meeting.</p>
            
            <h6 class="Citizen1">Citizen1.</h6>
            <p class="speech_Citizen1"> >He couldn't even get the loan of the hall at the Baths.</p>
